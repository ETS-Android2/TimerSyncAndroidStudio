# TimerSyncAndroidStudio
timer sync between some of phone - designed for a football game

# How to use
You just need to get the apk and you can use in apk 

Note that you must be connected to the network

You have several options in the application
- Decide how long you want the timer to be active

I made a refector for this app and changed the interface of the app so that it is better designed
